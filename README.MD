## README

To run this notebook (`map.ipynb`) you will need a few `Python` libraries. These can be installed with the provided `environment.yml` file. If you have `conda` installed, it is worth installing `mamaba` to speed up this process.

Once you have mamba installed in your terminal run:

``` mamba env create --file environment.yml```

This will create a environment called `flymap`, that has all the required python libraries.

Next you will activate it by running:

`mamba activate flymap`

Now you should be able to run the `map.ipynb` notebook. If you have `vscode`, click on the `.ipynb` file to open it. If not, in terminal in this directory run `jupyter-notebook map.ipynb` to start a notebook in your browser.
